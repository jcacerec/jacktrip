Jacktrip : Build Instructions

JackTrip: A System for High-Quality Audio Network Performance over the Internet.

The following are instructions for compiling Jacktrip from source.  Compiling from source is the best way to keep up with the latest changes, both stable and experimental.  For quicker ways to install Jacktrip, go to README.md in the root directory of the project.

Steps:
Dependencies
Build
Installation (Linux and OS X only)
Installation or Build Verification
---
Dependencies(for all operating systems):
g++
Qt 5.14.2
Jack
Note: rtaudio is no longer a dependency

All Linux

Fedora:
dnf install qt5-devel
dnf groupinstall "C Development Tools and Libraries"
dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
dnf install jack-audio-connection-kit-devel alsa-lib-devel iperf qjackctl audacity git
Clone the git repo and run ./build in the src directory or use QtCreator to compile

Ubuntu and Debian/Raspbian:
apt install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential librtaudio-dev qt5-default autoconf automake libtool make libjack-jackd2-dev qjackctl audacity git
Clone the git repo and run ./build in the src directory or use QtCreator to compile

Other Linux distributions:
the latest Qt
jack-audio-connection-kit-devel
Clone the git repo and run ./build in the src directory or use QtCreator to compile

If you are using yum you can just install them (as root) with:
   yum install jack-audio-connection-kit-devel
and install qt from the qt site.

OSX (skip the steps you don't need):

Install Jack2 https://jackaudio.org/downloads/
If this command returns the XCode version, you have it installed:
xcodebuild -version
If you don't have XCode, go to the AppStore to download and install it.
If this command returns the version number of the package manager Homebrew, you have it installed:
brew -v
If you don't have Homebrew, install it:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSLhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
To install git if you don't have it:
brew install git
Install and link qt5:
brew install qt5
brew link qt5 --force
Clone the git repo and run ./build in the src directory or use QtCreator to compile

---
Build (Linux or Mac OS X):
You can compile using the build script or QtCreator.

To clone the repo in the Terminal:
$ git clone https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip.git

To compile using the build script:
$ cd jacktrip/src
$ ./build
$ cd ../builddir
$ ls
You should see a 'jacktrip' executable in this folder.

If the build script doesn't work on a different Linux flavor, try building
the Makefiles yourself. You'd need qmake. Then you can build by:
$ qmake jacktrip.pro
$ make release

To build using QtCreator:
  * Open jacktrip.pro using QtCreator
  * Choose a correctly configured Kit

On MacOS X, QtCreator places the 'jacktrip' executabe by default in a folder with a name like 'build-jacktrip-Desktop_x86_darwin_generic_mach_o_64bit-Release.'

---
Installation on MacOS X (10.9 or higher) or Linux:

You need to have a working Jack installation on your machine (see Dependencies above).

To install using Terminal (skip the first three steps if you've already followed the Build instructions above):

$ git clone https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip.git
$ cd jacktrip/src
$ ./build
$ cd ../builddir
$ sudo cp jacktrip /usr/local/bin/
  (enter your password when prompted)

$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/jacktrip
  (now you can run jacktrip from any directory using Terminal)
  
---
Installation Verification on MacOS X or Linux:
If you have installed jacktrip, from anywhere in the Terminal, type:
$ jacktrip -v

If you have compiled from source without installing, in the /builddir directory type:
$ ./jacktrip -v

If you see something like this, you have successfully installed Jacktrip:
JackTrip VERSION: 1.xx

WINDOWS (XP and later)
- ASIO4all audio driver is required even with Audio interfaces that support ASIO: www.asio4all.com.
- Note: Some users have reported success using the PortAudio driver, though it is not currently supported.

Building
Note: WIN10BUILDINSTRUCTIONS.pdf (in the same directory as this file) has screenshots of the Windows 10 build process and step-by-step instructions.
If you do not have Git installed, download it from https://git-scm.com/download/win.
Open the command line by typing cmd.exe in the Windows search bar.
Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you would like to install jacktrip, e.g. `cd C:\Users\Your User Name\`.
Use `git clone https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip.git` to download a fresh copy of the repo or `git pull` to update your repo.

On Windows 10, the easiest way to build is in the command line:
To add the location of qmake to the path, in the Windows search bar, type "environment variable" and click on the Environment Variables button in the Advanced tab of System Properties.  Find the Path variable in System variables, click Edit, and enter the location of qmake, e.g. `C:\Qt\5.15.0\mingw81_64\bin`, where 5.15.0 is the version of Qt you installed.
To verify you have g++ installed, type `where g++` in the command line.  If the command returns `not found` rather than a path, go to the Qt Maintenance Tool, which might be in a directory such as `C:\Qt\maintenancetool.exe`, and remove, then reinstall Qt.
In the command line, use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory, e.g. `cd jacktrip` and execute the following commands:
mkdir builddir (this step creates the build directory, and is only necessary if you're building for the first time)
cd builddir
qmake -spec win32-g++ ../src/jacktrip.pro (you may skip this step if you're building for the first time)
mingw32-make clean (you may skip this step if you're building for the first time)
qmake -spec win32-g++ ../src/jacktrip.pro
mingw32-make release

On earlier Windows versions, the easiest way to build is to download the free Qt Creator IDE from https://www.qt.io/download since the jacktrip buildscript is written in qmake.
Open the `src/jacktrip.pro` and configure the project.
Make sure to select the MinGW compiler (for example the one shipped with QtCreator).
Building with Clang or Microsoft Visual Studio Compilers is currently not supported!

Download Jack2 from https://jackaudio.org/downloads/
Make sure to install Jack into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack` (as this is the path where the jacktrip build script will look for it).

Hit build in QtCreator.
Copy the dll files `Qt5Core.dll` and `Qt5Network.dll` from your compiler's bin directory, e.g. `C:\Qt\5.15.0\mingw81_64\bin` to the folder in your project where your `jacktrip.exe` is located, e.g. `C:\Users\Your Name\jacktrip\build-jacktrip-Desktop-Qt_5_15_0_MinGW_64_bit-Release\release`
In the above example, 5.15.0 is the version of Qt MinGW 64 bit is the compiler.  The folder names may vary according to the Qt and compiler versions you are using.

Note: compiling with modifications in the .pro file (like adding a new source or header file) requires
qmake which is only available in the Qt Creator package.

Build Verification:
In the search field (Windows key + R), enter cmd.exe to open the command line.  Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where the executable jacktrip.exe is located, e.g. `C:\Users\Your Name\jacktrip\build-jacktrip-Desktop-Qt_5_15_0_MinGW_64_bit-Release\release`.

From there, the following command should return the version of Jacktrip you installed:
jacktrip.exe -v

If you see something like this, you have successfully installed Jacktrip:
JackTrip VERSION: 1.xx
